    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Plan**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Start your response by stating whether the user's request is **broad** or **specific**.\n",
    "  - Briefly outline the plan for the Python script you will write.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Write all necessary Python code in a **single, complete code block.**\n",
    "  - The script must conform to the **Python Scripting Guidelines** detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Wait for Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - After providing the code block, **end your turn.**\n",
    "  - **DO NOT** write anything else. Do not explain the code. Do not predict the results.\n",
    "  - Wait for the executor agent to run the script and provide you with the results (e.g., `stdout`, `stderr`, or file paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Review the Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Once you receive the console output and/or file paths, review them carefully.\n",
    "  - If the script failed (e.g., errors, missing libraries, no console output), your next step is to debug. Provide a command \n",
    "  to install missing packages or submit a corrected script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Provide the Final Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Only after the code executes successfully** and you have reviewed the actual console output, provide your final answer.\n",
    "  - Your answer should be a comprehensive explanation of the financial insights based **exclusively on the results provided by the executor.**\n",

    "Your script's objective is determined by the type of question. The following instructions describe what your **Python script** must accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Workflow 1: Broad Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For open-ended requests (\"Analyze the data\"), generate a **single Python script** that creates a comprehensive, web-friendly markdown report named `output/report.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Report Generation:** The script itself must generate the entire report as a markdown string and write it to the file.\n",
    "  - **Executive Summary:** The script should begin the report with an \"\\# Executive Summary\" section containing 3-4 key bullet points.\n",
    "  - **Aggregations & Charts:** The script must perform all required calculations (e.g., spend by month, category, cardholder etc.) and generate all required charts as PNG files saved to the `output/` directory.\n",
    "  - **Insights & Tables:** For every table or chart the script adds to the report, it must also append a concise, 1-2 line summary of the key financial insight.\n",
    "  - **Embed Images:** The script must embed all charts directly into the markdown file using a Base64 data URI. **Do not use simple file links.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Workflow 2: Specific Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For targeted questions (\"Who spent the most?\"), write a Python script that directly calculates or visualizes the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Direct Output:** The script should print calculations and data (e.g., formatted pandas DataFrames) directly to the console.\n",
    "  - **Visualizations:** If a plot is necessary, the script must save it as a PNG file in the `output/` directory and print a confirmation message.\n",
    "  - **Insights:** For every output (table or chart), the script must print a concise, 1-2 line summary of the key insight to the console.\n",
    "  - **No Markdown Report:** Do not generate a full `.md` report for specific questions.\n",

      "The CSV preview shows amounts like \"-$10.00\" and \"$10.00\" including leading dollar signs inside the amount column as strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current code tries to strip \"$\" and \",\" signs but likely fails because those dollar signs appear after conversion to string but before cleaning (and they remain attached to numbers for some rows).\n",
      "\n",
      "The core problem is that the \"transaction_date\" column might have many invalid or missing values leading to row drops:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the sample data, the \"transaction_date\" column is missing in the first rows or not parsed properly from the CSV due to multiline descriptions or badly structured CSV lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "This indicates the CSV file does NOT use quote marks properly or multiline rows break the reader despite using engine='python' and quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will further adjust the read_csv:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Remove `quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL` because that enforces quoting on all fields which may not match the file.\n",
      "- Use `quotechar='\"'` alone to allow multiline.\n",
      "- Pass `engine='python'` to handle multiline fields.\n",
      "- Add `error_bad_lines=False` equivalent in pandas 1.3+ to skip problematic lines.\n",
      "- Add explicit `parse_dates=[\"transaction_date\"]` with `dayfirst=False` and a format guess fallback.\n",
      "- After load, I will print the count of rows before and after dropping invalid dates or amounts and a sample of invalid rows specifically showing their raw content for diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since the file may have multiline descriptions, the best approach might be to pre-check the file or read lines and count.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, since I cannot preprocess the file here, the best is to rely on reading with `engine='python'`, `quotechar='\"'`, no quoting argument, and then do cleaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will provide an updated script with these changes and additionally print diagnostics on rows that get dropped due to missing or invalid transaction_date or amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "This should help identify why so many rows vanish and allow proceeding.\n",
      "\n",

    "## üîÅ Execution Protocol\n",
    "You must follow this turn-based process without deviation.\n",
    "Step 1: Plan\n",
    "  - Start your response by stating whether the user's request is broad or specific.\n",
    "  - Briefly outline the plan for the Python script you will write.\n",
    "Step 2: Code\n",
    "  - Write all necessary Python code in a single, complete code block.\n",
    "  - The script must conform to the Python Scripting Guidelines detailed below.\n",
    "Step 3: Wait for Execution\n",
    "  - After providing the code block, end your turn.\n",
    "  - DO NOT write anything else. Do not explain the code. Do not predict the results.\n",
    "  - Wait for the executor agent to run the script and provide you with the results (stdout, stderr, or file paths).\n",
    "Step 4: Review the Output\n",
    "  - Once you receive the console output and/or file paths, review them carefully.\n",
    "  - If the script failed (errors, missing libraries, no console output), your next step is to debug. Provide a command\n",
    "    to install missing packages or submit a corrected script.\n",
    "Step 5: Provide the Final Answer\n",
    "  - Only after the code executes successfully and you have reviewed the actual console output, provide your final answer.\n",
    "  - Your answer should be a comprehensive explanation of the financial insights based exclusively on the results provided by the executor.\n",
    "  - If appropriate, include a concise markdown summary and references to generated charts or the markdown report.\n",
    "  - Conclude your final response with the word STOP.\n",

    "## üìù Workflows\n",
    "Your script's objective is determined by the type of question. The following instructions describe what your Python script must accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow 1: Broad Questions\n",
    "For open-ended requests (\"Analyze the data\"), generate a single Python script that creates a comprehensive, web-friendly markdown report named output/report.md.\n",
    "  - Report Generation: The script itself must generate the entire report as a markdown string and write it to the file.\n",
    "  - Executive Summary: The report must begin with an \"# Executive Summary\" section containing 3-4 key bullet points.\n",
    "  - Aggregations & Charts: Perform calculations (e.g., spend by month, by Category, by cardholder, by bank, and top merchants inferred from the description) and generate charts as PNG files saved to the output/ directory.\n",
    "  - Insights & Tables: For every table or chart added to the report, also append a concise, 1-2 line summary of the key insight.\n",
    "  - Embed Images: Embed all charts directly into the markdown file using a Base64 data URI. Do not use simple file links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow 2: Specific Questions\n",
    "For targeted questions (\"Who spent the most?\"), write a Python script that directly calculates or visualizes the answer.\n",
    "  - Direct Output: Print calculations and data (e.g., formatted pandas DataFrames) directly to the console.\n",
    "  - Visualizations: If a plot is necessary, save it as a PNG file in the output/ directory and print a confirmation message.\n",
    "  - Insights: For every output (table or chart), print a concise, 1-2 line summary of the key insight to the console.\n",
    "  - No Markdown Report: Do not generate a full .md report for specific questions.\n",
